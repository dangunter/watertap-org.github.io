# About

This is the source for the WaterTAP downloads website at https://watertap-org.github.io/

# NEW

The site is being (experimentally!) deployed from the /docs directory.

See the README.md in that directory for how to add a new link and deploy.
Any questions, ask Dan Gunter as this is all his fault.

------------------------------------
# OLD INFO

The website is built with Jekyll and Github Pages.

# Internal

If you are a release manager, you can add or modify releases by editing [_data/releases.yml](https://github.com/watertap-org/watertap-org.github.io/blob/main/_data/releases.yml)
